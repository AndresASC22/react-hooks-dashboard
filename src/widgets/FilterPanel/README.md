## Description

A multi-criteria product filter panel that demonstrates how to combine multiple filter states to dynamically filter and display a list of items. This widget teaches complex filtering logic and state coordination.

## Learning Objectives

- Manage multiple independent filter states
- Combine multiple filter conditions (AND logic)
- Filter arrays based on multiple criteria
- Work with different input types (text, select, checkbox)
- Display filtered results with counts
- Implement "clear all" functionality

### JavaScript Concepts
- Array filter() method with complex conditions
- String includes() for search
- Case-insensitive string comparison
- Multiple AND conditions in filter
