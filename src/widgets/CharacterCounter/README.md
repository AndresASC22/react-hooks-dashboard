# Character Counter Widget

## Description

A text input component that counts characters in real-time and provides visual feedback about character limits. This widget demonstrates controlled components and derived state calculations.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement controlled text input components
- Handle input change events
- Calculate derived values from state
- Provide real-time visual feedback
- Use conditional styling based on calculations
- Understand the concept of character limits

## Concepts Taught

### React Concepts
- Controlled components with `value` and `onChange`
- Event handling for text inputs
- Derived state (calculating values from state)
- Conditional rendering and styling
- Button disabled state

### JavaScript Concepts
- String length property
- Mathematical calculations
- Ternary operators for conditional values
- Template literals

### UI/UX Concepts
- Real-time feedback
- Character limits and validation
- Visual indicators (colors, progress bars)
- Warning states
- Progressive disclosure of information

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Textarea for text input
2. Display character count (current/max)
3. Show remaining characters
4. Visual feedback with color coding:
   - Green: Safe (>20 remaining)
   - Yellow: Warning (<=20 remaining)
   - Red: Over limit
5. Progress bar visualization
6. Clear button functionality

## Difficulty Level

Beginner - useState Basics

## Estimated Time

25-30 minutes
